```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  
  
### get fancy  

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE,outlier.color = "red") + stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar') + labs(title="Fancy notch boxplot \n with 2 lines")
```

This boxplot shows that there a higher amount of people would consume alcohol sit in the back of the class.

## Numerical Summarys 
```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```
People who sit in the back drink about 9 ounces per week. People who sit in the front drink about 2 ounces per week. People who sit in the middle drink about 3 ounces per week. People who sit in the back drink about 3 times as much as the rest of the class
## Inferential Tests

## Conclusions
